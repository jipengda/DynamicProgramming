#for multi-robot task allocation."
#In 2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference
#on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)
#(IEEE Cat. No. 04CH37566), vol. 1, pp. 698-705. IEEE, 2004.
# my evaluation: prime allocation

#"Risk-averse auction agents."
#In Proceedings of the second international joint conference
#on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems, pp. 353-360. ACM, 2003.
# I hope to check again since it mentioned dynamic programming

#3:
#Johnson, Luke, Sameera Ponda, Han-Lim Choi, and Jonathan How.
#"Asynchronous decentralized task allocation for dynamic environments."
#In Infotech@ Aerospace 2011, p. 1441. 2011.
# I don't think this is that important, CBBA as it has been verited
# CBBA is not a good idea for my project

#4:
#Choi, Han-Lim, Andrew K. Whitten, and Jonathan P. How.
#"Decentralized task allocation for heterogeneous teams with cooperation
#constraints." In Proceedings of the 2010 American Control Conference,
#pp. 3057-3062. IEEE, 2010.
#Another paper related to CBBA

#5:
#Whitten, Andrew K., Han-Lim Choi, Luke B. Johnson, and Jonathan P. How.
#"Decentralized task allocation with coupled constraints in complex missions."
#In Proceedings of the 2011 American Control Conference, pp. 1642-1649. IEEE, 2011.
#Very interesting, it may give some hints on elimination criterion related to my project

#6:
#Lagoudakis, Michail G., Marc Berhault, Sven Koenig, Pinar Keskinocak, and Anton J. Kleywegt.
#"Simple auctions with performance guarantees for multi-robot task allocation."
#In 2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)

# Very exciting paper, i think it may give a lot of help for my project

# I want to go to pool deck for a rest, i will come back for rest paper.
