#6:
#Lagoudakis, Michail G., Marc Berhault, Sven Koenig, Pinar Keskinocak, and Anton J. Kleywegt.
#"Simple auctions with performance guarantees for multi-robot task allocation."

#In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems(AAMAS),
#pages(in print), 2019
# Very exciting paper, i think it may give a lot of help for my project

# I want to go to pool deck for a rest, i will come back for rest paper.
# Pool deck is closed because of children games event, instead I played basketball in the Triple gym

#8:
#Gerkey, Brian P., and Maja J. Matarić. "A formal analysis and taxonomy of task allocation in multi-robot systems."
#The International Journal of Robotics Research 23, no. 9 (2004): 939-954.
#A good review for approaching start the introduction of task allocation

#9:
#Zlot, R., and Anthony Stentz.”Market-based multirobot coordination for complex tasks.”
#The International Journal of Robotics Research, 25(1), pp.73-101
# No need to dig in. It is related to inherent struction of complex tasks, which is not my work.

#10
#]Khamis, Alaa, Ahmed Hussein, and Ahmed Elmogy. "Multi-robot task allocation:
#A review of the state-of-the-art."
#In Cooperative Robots and Sensor Networks 2015, pp. 31-51. Springer, Cham, 2015.
#A good very literature review of MRTA and OTA, but not mention detailed algorithm about task allocation

#11:
#]Korsah, G. Ayorkor, Anthony Stentz, and M. Bernardine Dias.
#"A comprehensive taxonomy for multi-robot task allocation."
#The International Journal of Robotics Research 32, no. 12 (2013): 1495-1512.
#still taxonomy, not related to detailed algorithm

#12:
# Gerkey, Brian Paul. "On multi-robot task allocation." (2003).
# A very good dissertation to acknolwdege MRTA problem from a student's perspective

#13:
# Van Den Berg, Jur P., and Mark H. Overmars. "Prioritized motion planning for multiple robots."
# In 2005 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 430-435. IEEE, 2005
# It maybe helpful since it mentions A* method.

#14:
# Najafabadi, SayedJalil Modares. "Designing Multi-Drone Networks and Applications."
# PhD diss., State University of New York at Buffalo, 2017.
# It exclusively introducte the history of my project, and also it is from the same lab as mine. Very precious.
