# So in this file, I hope to solve that elimination problem to show in the meeting
# Also, I hope to do sth with my own EECPP project, see how the dynamic
# programming can apply to my project
# All help should be found from Lays.py
# So I think I need to add another criterion to solve the eliminate problem


def another():

  # I hope to have a variable to store cost
  lastLabelInforTime = 0
  lastLabelInforCost = 0
  if LabelInforTime
  # Why don't I attach LabelInforTime and LabelInforCost to each new added set to be added
  # I just tried a way, add LabelInforTime and LabelInforCost to each new added set to be added
  # However, I am not sure if it is right or wrong. It may take a lot of store units. Is there other better ways? I hope so
