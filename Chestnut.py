# Today I hope to make a general framework for one drone EECPP problem
# This project is slightly different from project in the paper
# I need to be considering well before action

# I want to define a test map first
# It will be a grid map of nodes, 14 nodes at most at this moment
# Probably I can refer figure in the paer, try to regard as physical
# object
